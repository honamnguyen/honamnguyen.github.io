I'm a 5th-year Ph.D. candidate in the Physics Department at UC Berkeley working with Professor Birgitta Whaley. I am particularly interested in the application of machine learning algorithms to enhance various facets of quantum computing, including pulse control, qubit readout, and error correction.
