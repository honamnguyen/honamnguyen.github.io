Work experience
======
*Summer 2021*
:   **Graduate Student Research Assistant**
:   *Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, Berkeley, CA*
    - Investigated Deep Reinforcement Learning application in continuous quantum control.
    - Developed an OpenAI‐compatible for simulating transmon qubits dynamics under control pulses.
    - Implemented Deep Q-Network (DQN)/Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) for discretized/continuous pulse amplitudes.
    - Demonstrated a 3x reduction in duration for singe-qubit operations while maintaining 99.9% fidelity.

*Summer 2018*
:   **Research Student**
:   *Perimeter Institute, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada*
    - Investigated a model-fitting algorithm from lambda-statistics on 2D timestreams.
    - Implemented the algorithm in Python and validated it on a simplified toy model for the full pulsar search problem.

*Summer 2017*
:   **Research Student**
:   *CERN, Geneva, Switzerland*
    - Validated material budget in the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) tracker.
