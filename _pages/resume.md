Experience
======
*06 - 08/2021*
:   **Graduate Student Research Assistant:** AI for quantum control
:   *Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory*
    - Developed an OpenAI-compatible gym to model the dynamics of transmon qubits under control pulses, and implemented multiple Q-learning algorithms to learn both discrete and continuous pulse amplitudes.
    - Achieved a 3x reduction in gate duration for single-qubit operations, while sustaining a fidelity of 99.9%.


*06 - 08/2018*
:   **Student Researcher:** Model-fitting with $$\lambda$$-statistics for pulsar search
:   *Perimeter Institute, Canada*
    - Investigated a $$\lambda$$-statistics-based model-fitting algorithm on time-series data.
    - Validated the algorithm's effectiveness using a simplified toy model featuring 2D timestreams, laying the foundation for its application to the full pulsar search problem.


*06 - 08/2017*
:   **Student Researcher:** Validation of material budget in the CMS tracker
:   *CERN, Geneva, Switzerland*
    - Modified existing C++ code and added Python scripts to extract azimuthal coordinate information for radiation length analysis in the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) tracker.
    - Identified non-constant radiation length values in the tracker's edge modules, offering initial insights for further improving the accuracy of the material budget estimation.
