> ... no $$Z$$ errors are harmful for $$|0\rangle_{\text{L}}$$ encoded with the Steane code... Because of the $$Z$$ stabilizer operators of $$|0\rangle_{\text{L}}$$ given above, arbitrary $$Z$$ errors are equivalent to no error or single-qubit $$Z$$ errors. - Goto

Thanks to Zack Weinstein for pointing out an intuitive recipe to convince yourself that this is the case. 

Consider an arbitrary multi-qubit $$Z$$ error:
1. If odd-weight, apply 4-qubit $$Z$$ stabilizers until we are left with a weight-1 error
2. If even-weight:<br/>
    a. Play with 4-qubit $$Z$$ stabilizers to see if it reduces to Identity<br/>
    b. OR apply logical $$Z$$ operator $$Z_{\rm L} = ZZZZZZZ$$ to get an odd-weight error<br/>
